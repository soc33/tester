# Web Dev Depot

Web Dev Depot is a Web Development Resource Repository meant to provide both the beginning learner and seasoned Web Developer with resources to help them along their journey.

## User Functionality

Web Dev Depot utilizes a system of menus, descriptions and resource cards that link to outside sources related to different web development categories. While no registration/login is necessary to use the site, if the user wishes to keep track of the resources they've viewed, as well as mark resources as liked or favorites, they will need to register and log-in. Logging in also allows the user to contact the site admin with general messages, to report a bug, or suggest a site to be added thru a built in contact form.
